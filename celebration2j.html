					Thursday, May 9, 2002 - Home
				</b>
				<br>
				Albuquerque to Orange County, what a drive. Our only real stop on the way was
				Flagstaff, Arizona. We found the two stores we visited last time, Bookman and
				Hastings. The Bookman had some great deals on old books and magazines, John
				bought a ton of stuff while I only got two old books. Hastings, which is next
				door, was basically a book/music/movie store. John got a few things there and I
				picked up another two books. After that we hit the local Target to get some
				chips and then headed home. We ended up getting in at around 11:30pm, we
				actually left Albuquerque at around 12 noon. Anyway, I don't mind saying that
				it sucks to be home, in a certain way anyway. I'd rather be back at the
				Celebration but oh well, what can you do? 
				<p>
				Just so you know, I've updated the map of the routes we took.  Hopefully I'll
				be able to get the pictures we took developed soon.

					Tuesday Night, May 7, 2002 - Albuquerque, New Mexico
				</b>
				<br>
				No update yesterday, but it's just as well, the trip was uneventful. We stopped
				in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Oklahoma has jack shit in it but it sure has plenty of
				Tunrpikes, it cost us $9 to drive through that crappy state. It didn't help
				that John forgot his wallet at the Motel 6 we stayed at and didn't realize it
				until we were 30 miles down the second Turnpike we went though. That cost us an
				extra $2 right there. It's also hot and humid as hell, really miserable. Now
				we're in Albuquerque, New Mexico. One of our stops on the way home last time,
				we're not in the same Motel 6 as last time but the price was right at this one
				so we're not worried about it. We just got back from getting some Domino's
				Pizza and we're in for the night. We're not sure if we're going to drive all
				the way home tomorrow, we know we want to stop in Flagstaff, Arizona tomorrow
				and spend a little time there. We'll just have to wait and see what happens.
				G'night

					Sunday Night, May 5, 2002 - Indianapapolis, Indiana
				</b>
				<br>
				Heh, no updates for 3 days.  That's because we literally ate, slept, and
				breathed Star Wars for those days and didn't have time for anything else,
				including news updates.  So here's a breakdown of the past few days.
				<p>
				<br>
				<b>
					Sunday, May 5, 2002 - Star Wars Celebration II
				</b>
				<br>
				Sunday morning we ended up getting up really late, around 11:30am. Because of
				that we missed one of the presentations we had hoped to see. The one with Peter
				Mayhew (Chewbacca), David Prowse (Darth Vader), and Kenny Baker (R2-D2) but oh
				well, we couldn't do it all, plus it had really wound down today so there
				really wasn't a lot of big stuff going on. We did get to see the the other
				presentation we had hoped to see today, the last one in the big Coruscant
				Ballroom, the Costume Contest. There were tons of good costumes and I got
				plenty of pictures of them, and of John and I with various characters. I hope
				all of them come out. Anthony Daniels hosted the contest and Warwick Davis,
				Peter Diamond (stunt coordinator for the Classic Trilogy) and Trisha Biggar
				(costume designer for the new trilogy) judged the contest. Like I said there
				was some amazing costumes and at the end it was a showdown between "Hoth" Luke
				with Wampa snow creature and "Hoth" Han with Taun Taun, "Hoth" Leia, and Dash
				Rendar (a book character). Both of the "sets" of costumed applicants had acted
				out scenes and both had fantastic costumes. In the end Luke and the Wampa won
				though I personally had hoped that the Taun Taun Han with friends would win.
				You'll see the pictures eventually if you have no idea what I'm talking about
				:-) After that there wasn't anything else going on since most everything there
				ended at 4:00pm. So we came back to the Motel and I worked on these makeup
				updates. They might not be as detailed as I wanted them to be since I didn't
				write them the day they happened but it's all the major things and besides, if
				I put wrote about all the things I saw this would turn into an online novel. It
				sucks that it's over, being around all these like minded people is great.
				Almost everyone I saw or talked with this weekend was a Star Wars fan and
				everyone was really nice. I'm going to miss this Celebration, just like the
				last one. It's going to blow having to come back to the real world but the the
				summer is almost here and there's plenty of fun stuff planned with my friends.
				Plus Attack of the Clones is coming out very soon so it won't be all that bad.
				Unless of course Chris was unable to get tickets, I still haven't heard from
				the bastard! Anyway, we head back tomorrow, we'll be traveling on classic route
				'66 for most of the way if I'm not mistaken. I'll probably update the site each
				night last on our trip out here so check back tomorrow. See you all later.

					Saturday, May 4, 2002 - Star Wars Celebration II
				</b>
				<br>
				Saturday morning we woke up a little late, at about 11:00am and didn't get down
				to the Celebration until about 12:00pm, too late to see the first presentation
				we wanted to see that day at 11:30. As it turns out though, we had set all our
				clocks and watches ahead an hour more than we should have, I guess because of
				all the time changes we had gone through. So up until the point when we were
				outside the convention center looking at the clock on the convention sign did
				we realize that we had been wrong the whole time. The stuff on Friday hadn't
				been pushed back an hour later and we hadn't gotten to the Celebration too late
				to see the presentation. Duh! We felt pretty retarded right about then. But
				anyway, we went and saw the presentation, another discussion with the book
				people and authors this time about the continuity between all the books and
				comics and stuff in the Star Wars Universe. It was quite interesting. After
				that we head over to the Exhibition hall again, this time they were handing out
				"The Essential Guide to Planets and Moons" (an essential guide I didn't have)
				for free for people to get signed by Dan Wallace the author. He's a really nice
				guy, and I'm not just saying that 'cause I got a free book. Unfortunately I
				didn't get the chance to have him sign my copy of The New Essential Guide to
				Characters which I had just bought a few days earlier. After that we left to
				see if we could get tickets for the Star Wars 25th Anniversary Concert with the
				indianapolis Philharmonic Orchestra up in the Coruscant ballroom later that
				night. We weren't able to go though since the tickets had sold out, a bummer
				for sure but there was other stuff to do that night. After getting denied with
				the tickets we split up so that I could go to the Celebration Store to pick up
				a shirt, hat and poster and John could go get his Wraith Squadron book signed
				by author Aaron Allston. I wish I could have gotten some of my books signed but
				I had forgotten to bring mine :-( I didn't end up coming away with anything
				from the store except for a piece of paper that said that my stuff would be
				shipped to me in 6-8 weeks. Apparently they had sold out of the Celebration
				shirts, hats and posters. John got his book signed by Allston though, so that
				was cool. We met back up a little while later and headed on over to the
				Tatooine room for the "Attack of the Fetts" presentation with Daniel Logan
				(Young Boba Fett from AotC) Jeremy Bulloch (Older Boba Fett from Classic
				Trilogy) and Tamuera Morrison (Jango Fett from AotC) and hosted by Scott
				Chernoff. It was a great presentation, I was surprised at how loose the actors
				where. Jeremy Bulloch and Tamuera Morrison even had a mock boxing match up on
				stage at the end. After that we turned around and got in line at the same room
				for the Warwick Davis(Wicket the Ewok, Willow, the Leprechaun among other
				characters) interview again hosted by Scott Chernoff. He was really friendly
				and was cracking plenty of jokes and even showed clips from a little
				documentary type thing he filmed while we was working on Return of the Jedi
				called Return of the Ewok. He mentioned that, because of legal issues and other
				stuff, it would be impossible to sell it or put it on the internet but the
				whole video was being shown upstairs in the Star Wars in Pop Culture
				presentation room. So of course after the Warwick Davis presentation we headed
				up stairs to the Pop Culture room. The Return of the Ewok was part of a 6 hour
				collection of video of Star Wars refences, commercials, jokes and other stuff
				from TV and movies. We ended up watching the stuff up there for 3 hours until
				they kicked us out at 9:30pm. After that we went down stairs to the Tatooine
				room room where they were showing The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the
				Jedi. ESB had already ended though so we just got to see RotJ. The fan
				participation in the movie was excellent, plenty of cheering and booing and
				stuff, it was really fun. That ended at 11:30pm so we headed back to the motel
				room afterwards and once again hit the sack pretty much right when we got in
				the door. 
				<p>
				<br>
				<b>
					Friday, May 3, 2002 - Star Wars Celebration II
				</b>
				<br>
				Friday we woke up at around 9:00am and got down to the convention center at
				around 10:30am. When we drove up, there was a huge line to get in wrapping half
				way around the block, it took us until about 12 noon to get in well after the
				first presentations had started and right when the first one we wanted to
				attend started, that being opening ceremonies in the big Coruscant Ballroom
				upstairs hosted by Anthony Daniels. Luckily it appeared that they had started
				everything a hour later than scheduled to compensate (there's a funny story
				about that coming up later) and we managed to get in. At the presentation
				Anthony interviewed Rick McCallum (Producer) and Hayden Christensen (Anakin
				Skywalker in AotC) and as a special treat Jim Ward (Head of Marketing for
				Lucasfilm) premiered the new "Yoda" commercial for us up on the big screen
				there. It started off like a Spiderman commercial, then went on to show scenes
				of Yoda in action from Attack of the Clones and when I say action I mean him
				actually battling and stuff. I probably should have changed my pants after
				seeing it, it was so good. Anyway, after that we head over to one of the
				smaller rooms to attend the New Jedi Order (new series of books that takes
				place 21 years after Retun of the Jedi) discussion with Shelly Shapiro from Del
				Ray Books, Sue Rostoni from Lucas Publishing and authors Aaron Allston, Troy
				Denning, James Luceno, and Bob Salvatore. They were talking about the new
				series and fielding questions from the audience. John asked a question about
				Luke and Leia finding out more about their parents as the books went on and
				they answered simply, yes. After that we spent some time in the Exhibition hall
				to pick up some freebies and check out some of the new products. Along with all
				the little goodies we both picked up an excellent Attack of the Clones graphic
				novel poster from the Dark Horse comics booth and got them signed by the artist
				Jan Duursema, all for free! After spending a little time in there we made our
				way over to the Tatooine room were Scott Chernoff (former editor for Star Wars
				Insider magazine) interviewed Lando Calrissian himself, Billy Dee Williams. He
				was really funny and took a lot of the wacko questions from the audience in
				stride. Later in the presentation they brought out John Hollis who played Lobot
				in The Empire Strikes back and reunited him with Billy Dee for the first time
				since working on ESB. Over all it was excellent and was one of the main reasons
				why drove all the way out here. After that we went upstairs to the Coruscant
				Ballroom again and waited to see the Star Wars Fan Film Awards, which is
				apparently supposed to be shown on the Sci-Fi channel soon. While waiting in
				line we met two local Star Wars fans who could both tell we were weren't from
				around here and one of them (a chick) thought I looked little like Rob Lowe,
				LOL. Anyway the Fan Film Awards were great though they ended kind of late,
				around 10:30pm. Aftwards we went back down stairs to the Tatooine room and sat
				and watched the last half of The Phantom Menace which they were showing on the
				Digital Projector they had set up there. After that they were going to show A
				New Hope but John didn't really feel like staying for that since it was so late
				(around 11:30pm) so we headed back to the Motel. We didn't actually get back to
				the Motel until about 12:30am since I had taken a wrong turn (most of the
				friggin streets are one way here) and got us lost for a bit. As you might
				imagine we hit the sack almost right when we walked in the door here.

				<b>
					Thursday, May 2, 2002 - Indianapolis, Indiana
				</b>
				<br>
				Per usual we woke up right before checkout and drove over to the other Motel 6.
				It was decent enough though it seems to be a little dumpier than some of the
				others we've stayed in. It's the cheapest one so far though so we can't really
				complain too much. After getting settled in we decided to drive around and
				check out some of malls and bookstores as well as check out the convention
				center. There was nothing too special at the book stores (Boarders and B&N) or
				the malls we went to but the convention center was great. As it turns out it's
				near the heart of downtown Indianapolis and is connected via Skywalks (heh,
				heh) to hotels and a mall. If I would have known that I think I would have at
				least thought about spending more money and staying in one of those hotels, I
				wouldn't have had to drive around hardly at all here. Anyway, when we got
				there, there was already a bunch of Stormtroopers from the 501st walking the
				streets and we were able to go inside the convention center and check things
				out while they were setting everything up. We didn't stick around there very
				long though and we went on to check out some other stuff and drive around a bit
				and ended up getting back to the motel around 9:00pm. Then we just prepared for
				the next day and went to bed. 
				<p>
				<br>
				<b>
					Wednesday Night, May 1,  2002 - Indianapolis, Indiana
				</b>
				<br>
				Indianapolis! We're finally here, a day early too. Once again we woke up and
				left late so we didn't get into town until about 9:00pm, all the friggin' time
				changes we've been through haven't helped much. The trip over was uneventful
				except for the 4 big rig trucks that had somehow tipped over and crashed on the
				road. They weren't all together either, they were spaced out for miles, we're
				not sure how it happened but it sucks. Luckily it didn't look like anyone got
				seriously injured. The Motel 6 we're at right now is really nice, the furniture
				and wallpaper and stuff are really top notch, I think they must have remodeled
				recently. Unfortunately we won't be staying here since they're all booked up
				this weekend, tomorrow we're moving to another Motel 6 equally close to the
				convention center. I reserved a room at that one a few hours ago just to be
				safe. Well there's not much more to say, we don't have any real plans for
				tomorrow yet since we have a free day so maybe I'll get some decent sleep.
				We'll just have to see what happens tomorrow :-) 
				<p>
				<i>
					Makeup Update
				</i>
				<br>
				I didn't mention this the day it happened but when we were at a rest stop on
				our way to Denver I managed to break off the end of the ear thing on my sun
				glasses when they were hanging out of my pocket while I was walking up some
				steps.  I wasn't wearing them because I was taking a picture for two old dudes.
				 I thought I was going to have to buy new ones but I really didn't want to
				trash them because my uncle gave them to me.  Luckily I was able to get some
				super glue in town at the Target we went to and I glued them back together. 
				They actually look and work fine again and it only cost me like a buck for the
				glue.
				<p>
				<i>
					News Flash
				</i>
				<br>
				As I was writing this a tornado warning was issued for some of the counties in
				the lower part of the state.  It'd be just our luck that a tornado would hit
				right before the Celebration, heh.
				<p>
				<br>
				<b>
					Tuesday Night, April 30,  2002 - Kansas City, Missouri
				</b>
				<br>
				<b>
					<i>
						Fuck Kansas!
					</i>
				</b>
				(you'll see why in a minute)  Once again we planned on waking up early but
				ended up sleeping in and leaving at around 12:00pm, it didn't help that we had
				to stop by Media Play again to get a price adjustment on those books we bought
				before we left.  It was kind of funny though because the woman working the
				counter seemed really annoyed that we had bothered to come back to the store to
				get our $1.80 each back.  After that we left town and headed into Kansas.  As
				it turns out Kansas is pretty boring, there's fuck all there except for State
				Troopers who enjoy giving out tickets for going 14 miles over the speed limit
				on dead straight interstate highways.  So I got my first ticket in Kansas and
				got dinged for $113, it was John's fault though, he laughed at a guy that got
				pulled over as we were entering the state.  I told him not to but the damage
				was already done and we were jinxed.  Also, I'm sure the trooper was a Star
				Trek fan or something and saw the Star Wars stuff on my car, there's no other
				explaination for him taking notice of us and actually giving us a ticket
				instead of just a warning, probably hates Californians too.  After that we high
				tailed it out of Kansas (at a somewhat reasonable speed) and stopped in Kansas
				City . . . on the Missouri side.  Looking back it's kind of funny, as John
				pointed out, we drove all the way across Kansas and the only person we met or
				talked to was that crappy State Trooper, heh.  Other than that nothing else
				happened, it was a long drive so we didn't do anything in the city, just got
				our room at Motel 6 (great price this time, just like our trip) grabbed some
				Wendy's for dinner and went back to the room.  So that's it, we have another
				long drive ahead of us tomorrow but it'll be all worth it when we pull into
				Indianapolis tomorrow evening.  G'night
				<p>

				<b>
					Monday Night, April 29,  2002 - Denver, Colorado
				</b>
				<br>
				Today we had planned on waking up relatively early (9:00am), in hopes of getting into Denver with enough time to fool around in the city and visit some of the places we went to last time.  As it turned out we didn't leave Grand Junction until about 12:00pm so we didn't get into Denver until about 4:30pm or so.  We planned on staying at the same Motel 6 as last time so the first thing we did when we got in town was search for it.  We stopped at one that we believed to be the one we stayed at last time but upon close inspection of the place we discovered that it wasnt, at that point we believed that the old one was demolished and moved across the street since my only real reference was a Burger King that was nearby.  As it turns out we had stopped at the wrong one and there just happened to be a Burger King nearby positioned in the same place in regards to the street and off ramp as the real Motel 6.  It was only after driving to another Motel 6 (in hopes of it being cheaper) that we discovered that we got the wrong one.  I saw the other one while we were driving down the freeway and recognized the street name, Federal Blvd., so we stopped there.  It wasn't any cheaper than the other Motel 6 but it was a decent price.  After checking in we went over to the Air and Space musuem where the first Celebration was held.  The area has been built up a lot in three years, lots of new housing developments where just dirt and mud was last time.  The musuem itself was pretty much the same, we took some pictures of the area and of us in front of the musuem.  After that we went over to a really cool media store called Media Play, the last time we were here it had some great deals on Star Wars stuff plus it was were we saw all The Phantom Menace merchendise for the first time, it was also the place that wouldn't except my grandmother's credit card when I tried to buy a bunch of old Star Wars Adventure Journals that were still there, a terrifc find incase you were wondering >
				:-( and of course they weren't there 
				this time.  The funny thing about going to Media Play again was the fact that
				we took pictures of the outside and the inside, I know that the people working
				there probably though we were nuts, butwe only took one picture of the inside. 
				John and I both ended up getting some new Star Wars book there since they had
				some great discounts, we both got the two new Jedi Quest books and I picked up
				the New Essential Guide to Characters.  I was going to get the Attack of the
				Clones novel since it was only 15 bucks but I forgot, we might stop by there
				tomorrow before leaving to pick it up though.  After visiting Media Play we
				went to Toys R Us next door.  It was the same Toys R Us John and I had lined up
				at for the sunday midnight sale of the new The Phantom Menace toys three years
				ago.  We didn't end up buying anything that time but this time John bought the
				new Padme figure and a Padme poster, I bought nothing :-)  The funny thing
				about that night three years ago was that the Media Play store, in the same
				plaza, opened up at midnight to sell some new Star Wars merchendise as well
				though almost nobody went over there, except for us of course.  That was when I
				got denied on those Adventure Journals.  Anyway, after all that we stopped at
				Target to get some tape for a "Star Wars Celebration or bust" sign we're
				putting on the car tomorrow and then we went and visited the local Barnes &
				Noble (nothing too exciting there of course).  After that we ate cheap at Taco
				Bell and then visited and took pictures of the church/community center were
				they held the Jar Jar Jam last time.  It was getting pretty late and it was
				kind of a crappy neighborhood so we didn't stick around there very long.  We
				then came back to the Motel and here we are, it's Almost 1 o'figgin'clock in
				the morning and I'm updating this crummy website
				when i know I should be sleeping so we can make it to Kansas City tomorrow at a
				decent hour.  So that will do it for tonight, a long drawn out update with
				plenty of spelling mistakes and run on sentances but I don't care, I'm going to
				bed zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz :-)
				<p>
				P.S.  Unfortunate news today, although we had only asked last night mine and
				John's friend Jess won't be able to go to the Celebration, she lives nearby in
				Dayton Ohio.  Maybe next time :-( 
				<p>
				<br>
				<b>
					Sunday Night, April 28,  2002 - Grand Junction, Colorado
				</b>
				<br>
				We woke up around 11:00am today, just in time to get cleaned up and pack up
				before checkout time at noon.  I would have never though that it would take so
				long for two guys to get ready in the morning, but I guess we had to pack up
				and stuff too.  For breakfast we went to the Denny's next door, the same one we
				ate at last time actually and both got Grand Slam Sunshines since it was just
				about the cheapest thing on the menu.  It was pretty tasty though and filled me
				up good.  After breakfast and stopping by the bank we left town on the I-15
				heading east at about 1:00pm.  The scenery in Utah was amazing, better than
				last time since it's sunny now and last time it was overcast the whole time. 
				We got some good pictures at a scenic turn off, one we actually stopped at and
				took pictures of 3 years ago but none of those pictures turned out, hopefully
				these new ones will.  The rest of the drive was pretty uneventful, not that I
				mind of course :-)  We got into Grand Junction at about 6:00pm and checked into
				the Motel 6 right away, the prices are a bit more expensive than last time but
				oh well.  After checking in we went and took a look around at some of the
				stores we stopped at last time, Toys R Us (was closed early since it was
				sunday), Barnes & Noble (nothing exciting there of course) and Target.   We
				went to Target 'cause we're thinking about getting a sleeping bag so we can
				just get single rooms to save a little money.  It doesn't matter
				to me too much since it'll be John sleeping on the floor.  I'm doing all the
				driving and I need a nice soft bed after being on the road all day ;-)  Anyway,
				that's it for today, I still have to make a phone call to try and insure that I
				(and who ever else is going with me, 9 people at my current count) get to see
				the earliest showing of Attack of the Clones when it opens.  Until  tomorrow .

					Saturday Night, April 27,  2002 - St. George, Utah
				</b>
				<br>
				As luck would have it I can use Netzero on the laptop I brought and use the
				phone line in the motel room to connect to the internet.  Anyway, my buddy John
				and I are in St. George
				Utah now, we ended up getting in kind of late (9:00pm) 'cause we didn't leave
				Orange County until 4:00pm.  The Motel 6 we stayed at last time around was
				booked up so we're staying at the Travel Lodge next door.  It's not quite as
				nice as the Motel 6, I saw a roach crawling on ceiling a few minutes ago, but
				it's better than nothing.  We had some Taco Bell for dinner, the same one we
				ate at last time, unfortunately this time there wasn't a bunch of cute blondes
				working there  :-(  Well that's it for tonight, for those of you that actually
				visit my site I'll be updating it on the road, since I know I can get online.

				<br>
				Well, time to go.  I plan on having plenty of pictures and stuff to scan
				when I get back, including lots of pictures of the trip itself.  I'm bringing a
				laptop and with any luck I'll be able to get online while I'm out on the road, I
				doubt Motel 6 is going to be providing any kind of net access though :-(

					Monday, April 22,  2002
				</b>
				<br>
				Just a few more days, John comes down on Thursday and we leave on Saturday.  It
				should take us about 5 days to make it to Indianapolis.  We plan on taking the
				northern route stopping in all the same cities as before and spending a day in
				Denver, to reminisce.  Then taking the southern route (maybe Classic Route 66
				most of the way) home stopping in the same places we did on the way back from
				the first Celebration, the final routes for the trip home are yet to be
				determined :-)
				<p>
				I've put up a road map of the United States showing our routes for the first
				Celebration and our planned routes for the upcoming Celebration.  I also added
				a few pictures to the Celebration I picture page, I'll probably be adding more
				right before the trip too.

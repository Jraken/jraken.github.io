						<img src="jayc1.jpg" alt="Ahhhhhhhhh">
						<p>
						This was so cool, we went to the site of the original Celebration and took a
						few pictures. Here's me relaxing in front of the entrance.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="jayeisenhowersign.jpg" ALT="Thank you Mr. President">
						<p>
						At this point I can't remember if this was on the way to or from the
						Celebration II.  If I had to guess I'd say we were on our way there, I don't
						remember taking a lot 
						of pictures on the way back.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="johneisenhowersign.jpg" ALT="Ditto">
						<p>
						Yeah, so this was John's picture at that rest stop.  Hell, I can't even imagine
						why we took pictures next to that sign LOL! 
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="jayjawa.jpg" ALT="Hmmmmmmmm">
						<p>
						Looking back, it's really funny that I actually had a conversation with a
						person in a Jawa costume, a very nice Jawa costume.  She was really cool though
						(yes, it was a woman in that getup)
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="jaycrumb.jpg" ALT="Salacious Crumb">
						<p>
						That guy was making that Salacious Crumb puppet squawk in my ear.  John took
						this picture after the costume contest (unfortunately John's picture with
						Salacious didn't turn out), the last even of the whole Celebration.  *sigh*
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="johnmaul.jpg" ALT="*cough, ack*">
						<p>
						This guy's costume was pretty cool, my version of the picture didn't turn out
						but John's is much better anyway, the look on his face and all.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="johnprotect.jpg" ALT="Bees!">
						<p>
						We took this at a rest stop in Colorodo (where I broke my sun glasses).  I
						thought this picture was funny because John was protecting his Sprite from some
						bees.  Killer Sprite Drinking Bees.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="johnjayleia.jpg" ALT="Grrrrrrrr">
						<p>
						He's hard to see but the Han Solo in this picture was at the first Celebration.
						 I never got a picture of him then but I have a few of him now.  More of him in
						later updates I think.  Oh, and the Leia was nice :-)  Yeah yeah, the Boba Fett
						and Stormtrooper in the back were nice too.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="johnjayarrested.jpg" ALT="Caught again!">
						<p>
						Here we are, getting in trouble with the Imperials again, just like at the
						first Celebration.  Except this time they shot John on sight.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="jayjohnfalcon.jpg" ALT="Common ol' buddy, let me borrow the Falcon">
						<p>
						Ahhhh I love this picture, it's a toss up between this one and the next one for
						my favorite.  We tried to act out some sort of Han and Lando scene in front of
						a big matte painting of the Falcon in Retun of the Jedi.  So damn funny.  To
						John and I anyway :-)
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="johnlunchutah.jpg" ALT="Wish I could be back there again">
						<p>
						I love this picture too, just the whole scene and stuff.  Very nice.  I wish I
						could be back there right now *sigh*  
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="carden.jpg" ALT="She's got it where it counts.">
						<p>
						This was outside the old hanger where the first Celebration was, a lot
						different without all the rain, people and giant balloon Star Wars Pepsi cans.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="tentarea.jpg" ALT="So barren">
						<p>
						I like this picture.  I accidently got John and mine's shadow in there.  Great
						stuff.  This was where the event tents were setup, they held the interviews
						with the actors and some of the crew that worked on The Phantom Menace in them.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="jedifish.jpg" ALT="Don't take her fish">
						<p>
						*Ahem*  Yeah, that's a big fish.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="johnmess.jpg" ALT="Slobs">
						<p>
						Here's our hotel room in Indianapolis.  Yeah we were a couple of slobs all
						right.  Ugh, I almost forgot about the 100lbs pink laundry basket.  
						
						  
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="mediaplay.jpg" ALT="Blah">
						<p>
						Why did we take a picture of Media Play (in Denver)?  Well, because it was an
						awesome store during the first Celebration in Denver.  They had all sorts of
						good books onsale.  They had a bunch of Star Wars Adventure Journals I didn't
						have that were out of print back then (still are) but I couldn't get them
						because I didn't have the money.  That sucked at the time.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="mediaplay2.jpg" ALT="Interior">
						<p>
						Why the hell did we take a picture of the interior of media play?  Well,
						because it was an awesome store during the first Celebration in Denver, of
						course.  This was funny because John took it and I was kind of nervous about us
						taking a picture 'cause I thought we would look mighty suspicious.  Like we
						were scoping the place out for a robbery.  Some woman that worked there gave us
						a funny look while we were doing in too.  Ahhh that was funny.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="celebsw.jpg" ALT="That's right">
						<p>
						I dont' think I took this picture until the last day.  You can't really see
						from this picture but the Indiana Convention Center is in Down Town
						Indianapolis.  It's very nice there.  If I had turned right while taking that
						picture I'd be looking at a cool church.  I think I scanned the picture I took
						of the church's two steeples.  Should show up later.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="jayutah.jpg" ALT="Out of order">
						<p>
						A picture of me in Utah.  I'm not a big fan of it but it's ok.  We should have
						taken it at a different angle maybe.  I love the clouds though.  It's like a
						matte painting.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="landochewie.jpg" ALT="How you doing Chewbacca?">
						<p>
						My two favorite costumes.  The Lando costume (Lando's disguise in Return of the
						Jedi) was really well done.  I can't remember his alias' name though, argh!  I
						don't think I've ever seen anyone with a costume like that, his was hand made,
						very nice.  The Chewbacca costume was just funny, probably the best anyone
						could do without professional help, but still funny.  The guy was making all
						sorts of wookiee noises too.  Really funny.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="messroom.jpg" ALT="Slobs again">
						<p>
						Another shot of our messy motel room.  Those peanut butter and honey sandwiches
						were yummy.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="palpy.jpg" ALT="Weirdo">
						<p>
						This guy had an awesome young Palpatine costume (Palpatine from the Dark Empire
						comics).  The guy was wacky though, I tried talking to him and comment on his
						costume but he was way too into character.  Pretty funny though.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="jangophat.jpg" ALT="His father this time">
						<p>
						It was Boba Phat last time, now it's Jango Phat.  I must say that Jango Phat's
						partner is a lot better looking than Boba's at the first Celebration.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="church.jpg" ALT="Ding Dong">
						<p>
						This is that church I was talking about and some of downtown.  Ahhh I wish we
						could have stayed at that Hyatt.  It had a skywalk going to the parking garage
						and then the convention center.  We wouldn't have had to go outside for the
						whole weekend.  Oh well, it was fun at the Motel 6.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="costumes.jpg" ALT="Lovely">
						<p>
						The wampa behind Anthony Daniels there was probably the most impressive
						costume.  It wasn't my favorite though, that one is next.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="handash.jpg" ALT="And I thought they smelled bad on the outside.">
						<p>
						Same Han Solo from before, but this was his entry in the costume contest.  My
						favorite costume by far.  His buddy there is Dash Rendar, a character from the
						Shadows of the Empire novel.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="ladymaul.jpg" ALT="Nice">
						<p>
						Lady Maul, very nice.  Not a great picture but 
						she actually has a 
						<a href="http://www.mirax.iwarp.com/" TARGET="_Blank">
							website
						</a>
						 
						with better pictures of that and some of her other costumes.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="line.jpg" ALT="Long">
						<p>
						The line was long but it didn't take long to get in.  It was moving at this
						point.  The funniest part was when we got closer to the entrance a couple
						passed us having fight for some reason.  The guy's girlfriend was yelling and
						walking away from him and he was appologizing profusely following behind.  I
						think I saw them later that day though and they seemed to have made up.  He
						probably looked at a girl in a Slave Leia getup for too long, heh.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="plokoon.jpg" ALT="Jedi">
						<p>
						A nice Plo Koon costume.  I think he made the mask himself, very impressive.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="carthumbs.jpg" ALT="Sexy Thumbs">
						<p>
						I'm pretty sure this was a test picture, that white car certainly wasn't too
						interesting.  Nice picture of my hands at the wheel.  That's Utah by the way.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="grandjunct.jpg" ALT="Damn we need a zoom lense">
						<p>
						I guess we were trying to get a picture of that plane statue.  I think the
						picture is silly and worth posting because you can see John taking the picture
						in the side mirror.  This was Grand Junction, Colorodo as we were leaving the
						Motel 6 there.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="johncrumb.jpg" ALT="So it did come out">
						<p>
						I guess I was wrong, it did come out, just not very well.  Ahhh good ol'
						Salacious Crumb.  I'm glad this one did come out after all.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="motelschool.jpg" ALT="A fine educational facility">
						<p>
						I remember telling Jenni about this and she finally gets to see it.  This looks
						like a motel but is infact a school.  An elementary school if I remember
						correctly.  An interesting way to save money when you need another school. 
						It's things like this that make me eager for the road trip to the next
						Celebration.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="stgeorgedt.jpg" ALT="St. George">
						<p>
						A main strip in Saint George, Utah.  It hadn't changed much since John and I
						stayed there on our way to the first Celebration and I reckon it will be pretty
						much the same if we pass through there next time.  Nice place.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="boushh.jpg" ALT="Yup">
						<p>
						I can't remember taking this picture, maybe John did.  Nice Boushh costume.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="fetts.jpg" ALT="Fetts">
						<p>
						Three great Fett costumes.  
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="hanlando.jpg" ALT="Han and Lando">
						<p>
						Here's these two guys again, this time together.  This Han guy can't help but
						strike a pose every time someone takes a picture of him.  I can only imagine
						how many pictures he's posed for at these Celebrations and other sci-fi
						conventions.  Ahhhh I'd probably strike a pose too if I had a Han costume.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="stormelvis.jpg" ALT="Riiiight">
						<p>
						The King is alive and a big Star Wars fan.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="sgmotel.jpg" ALT="Roach Motel">
						<p>
						My car parked at the Travel Lodge we stayed at in Saint George, Utah.  Not a
						bad place, if you like roaches crawling on the ceiling.
						
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<IMG SRC="denverm6.jpg" ALT="Denver">
						<p>
						Ahhh yes, the Motel 6 in Denver.  As quickly as I had come up with the idea of
						taking pictures of my car outside our motels, I got bored of it.  Well,
						actually I forgot to take one in Grand Junction and then I did take one in
						Denver but just said "screw it" and saved my film after that.

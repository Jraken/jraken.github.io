<br>
I awoke today after a great sleep ( common since after the Celebration! ) and we left Flagstaff, passing through the forests of Arizona, moving south to Phoenix, where we stopped for a lunch at Whataburger ( "What a burger!" ) and visited a local mall ( where, of course, we saw The Hitcher II...again -- this time for only $ 3.99. ) We hadn't gone south for the CII trip, so it was a real treat to see Phoenix again and really absorb the city and surrounding area. 
<p>
As per usual in AZ, it was nice and warm, and we saw lots of cacti as we moved southwest towards Yuma -- where we drove past the sand dunes of Imperial County, where they filmed Jabba's sail barge battle for Return of the Jedi. 
<p>
Finally, after not too long ( and with a sunset awaiting us over the water ), we made our way into San Diego and the relatively short trek up north to Orange County. The sun was gorgeous as it set into thick rainclouds -- the perfect way for California to welcome us home. And boy were we happy to see those crappy California drivers again.
<p>
Well, that's the trip in a nutshell pretty much. Tomorrow we plan to celebrate with a visit to either Chuck E. Cheese's or Hometown Buffet. So what did I think of this trip, by itself, and in comparison with the last two? It was awesome. 
<p>
Even though it was rife with pitfalls and a bit melancholy, and nothing came of anything between Heather and I -- I wouldn't change a thing. As I've told Jay and others the past couple of days, the entire theme of this journey has been "Expect the unexpected". No matter how much you plan...something different will happen ( The Hitcher II, Jess, Heather... ). And rather than be brought down by that, I accepted it, and I feel all the more stronger for it. What will happen in the future between me and Heather? I don't know. Time will tell. But I can say that I learned a lot from this whole experience, met many friends -- old and new, saw people and sights that I will never forget, and in the end, that's all I could've hoped for.

Before I fell asleep last night I happened to notice some strange glowing markings on the wall above my bed.  I immediately thought of strange satanic rituals and demons while John theorized it was some sort of gateway to another dimension (Twilight Zone anyone?).  Finally after being disturbed for a few minutes we figured out that it must have been some kids using some sort of glow paint or something.  Seeing the markings inspired us to grab my little radio out of the car and listen to some Coast to Coast before going to bed.  Unfortunately neither of us lasted more than 5 minutes before falling asleep.  Oh well, at least I woke up the next morning without having any satanic dreams or run-ins with demons.
<p>
No demons, but the remnant of my cold from a few days ago has been pestering all day me.  Even though the bulk of the cold is gone I'm still overly sensitive to pressure changes and all the ups and downs of driving through Arizona and California has wreaked havoc with my ears.  I was hoping that my ears would pop while we were in Phoenix but alas, they remained plugged.  We stopped at what we assumed is the same mall we visited on the first trip and after that ate at Whataburger.  I had a really good spicy salsa and pepper jack cheese chicken sandwich that cleared up my sinuses a bit.
<p>
We drove through the Yuma Proving Grounds and were attacked by a large wasp type creature when we stopped to take some pictures of the sign outside the military installation there.  John was too afraid to even roll down the window to take my picture by the sign, I myself jumped out of the car and ran to the sign to have the picture taken.  It was tricky getting back in the car without letting the killer bug inside.  Obviously the Hitcher can take on many different forms...
<p>
The rest of the drive was pleasant going through the Imperial Dunes and the southern most part of California.  We were welcomed home by speeding drivers who all own the road, San Onofre power plant, the sign warning drivers about illegals crossing the freeway and of course a beautiful sunset.
<p>
Well that's it, that's the trip. I'm not sure about John but I'm planning on wrapping it all up with final thoughts soon, after things sink in a little more.  I'll also continue to add pictures to the website and maybe some follow up entries concerning events I forgot or didn't feel like mentioning at the time.  Anyway, until then...

Albuquerque, New Mexico to Flagstaff, Arizona

<br>
</font>

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#E4C9C9;">
<b><i>John</i></b>
<br>
Today we left Albuquerque at a decent time, after stopping for a short Weinerschnitzel breakfast. As we made our way out of the city and into Arizona, we thought about taking a detour through the National Petrified Forest, but instead opted to go by the Arizona Meteor Crater site. It was a bit costly at $ 12 to get in, but we went for it and got some great pictures. As we gazed down into the crater, it started to rain a little bit, so we jetted after not too long.
<p>
After only a few hours, we made it into Flagstaff. We had thought about not staying here, or perhaps going further, to Phoenix, to stay the night -- but we decided to really take our time, since Flagstaff had some of our favorite stores -- Hastings books, and Bookman's. We also went by our favorite local Target, and by the end of the night, the media stores in Arizona had once again chastened my favoritism for them as I walked away with nearly all of the Jedi Quest books and various other literary tomes of great value for bargain prices. 
<p>
Before we retired at Motel 6, we also went up one of the nearby mountains and got some pictures of Lowell Observatory, and some great bird's eye shots of the city. Ah, Flagstaff. I love it. Until tomorrow...
<br><br>
</font>

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#A4BFEC;">
<b><i>Jason</i></b>
<br>
We had breakfast at the Weinerschnitzel in honor of our eating there during our trip back from the first Celebration.  We were forced to find the cheapest food possible when we ran out of money.  After stopping to eat there we had little reason to hang out in Albuquerque so we struck out for Flagstaff, AZ.
<p>
We had so much extra time on this leg of the trip that we took our time and almost drove through the Petrified Forest but instead decided that visiting Meteor Crater would satisfy our need to visit a natural wonder.  Though the entry fee was a little steep, the crater was amazing.  Seeing it on TV in movies and documentaries does it little justice, I couldn't believe how massive the hole is.  The weather could have been better while we were there but I managed to get some good pictures and possibly a really good panoramic picture of the crater before it started sprinkling too hard.
<p>
Along the way to Flagstaff we saw something that I don't remember seeing on either of the last two road trips but I had heard about from Kate a while ago.  Stewart's Fossils and Petrified Wood and stuff... it doesn't really have a title but it does have big dinosaurs eating people and ostriches that bite.  I don't know how I forgot about this place or managed to not see the statues and signs the last two times but this time we exited the highway to take pictures.  I kind of regret not going inside to really check the place out but maybe next time.  Anyway, I did get good pictures of all the crazy stuff outside.  One thing I do recall seeing on the last two trips was the dino statues for the Dinosaur Museum near Stewart's.  I snapped some good pictures of those as well.
<p>
Flagstaff was just as I remembered it.  We went up to check out the Lowell Observatory and got a great view of the Flagstaff cityscape.  We found our original Motel 6 this time though we weren't able to get our original room, apparently not all Motel 6's records of what rooms people stayed in go back 6 years.
<p>
That's it for tonight, g'night.

Amarillo, Texas to Albuquerque, New Mexico

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#E4C9C9;">
<b><i>John</i></b>
<br>
After a restful night's sleep, we got up and got breakfast ( well, snacks... ) at a gas station, and then went over to Hastings, which didn't have many deals. As we left Amarillo, we planned to do something different for our route to New Mexico this time...go to Roswell. So we made our way down the smaller highways, which was rife with dusty, decrepit farming towns, filled with Mexican resturants and truck repair shops. The "desperation of nowhere" was a phrase that filled my mind. As we passed through these towns and into NM, we played my Laserlight CD of Greatest Western Theme Songs.
<p>
Finally, we got to Roswell...but the town was larger than we expected, and we were seeing no signs of UFO stuff that it's famous for. Jay said, "Where's all the goofy alien shit?" Indeed, where was it? But finally, in a small downtown area, there it was, and we took the time to get many pictures and walk through the Roswell UFO museum and research center ( er, one of many... ) which had recreated alien bodies, equipment and a military office recreation circa 1947, and many newspaper articles, maps and written testimonies by various people. After we had lunch at a local gift shop/deli ( I got the "Roswell" sandwich... ), and we made our way north-west towards Albuqurque -- past shrubbed dusty fields -- I reflected on the fact that over fifty years ago, right in the general area we were, right now -- history was made. Not just any history, but possibly the greatest moment since the genesis of mankind ( if the Roswell Incident is indeed true, which 98% of me believes. ) Heady stuff. Oh yes...we stopped at another Hastings, and Jay got The Essential Cusco. Coast To Coast fans will recognize the group.
<p>
Finally, we arrived in Albuquerque ( going past Socorro, where there was another famous UFO sighting...and White Sands nuclear testing grounds ), staying at the same Motel 6 as we did in '99. We got some Domino's pizza, and the night ended. Tomorrow should be interesting, as we either go all the way home, or take our time and see the sights of Arizona. See you soon...

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#A4BFEC;">

<br>
<b>"Where's all the goofy alien shit?"</b>
<br>
Rosewell was a bit bigger that I expected and it doesn't milk the UFO thing as much as I expcted it to.  It was only the old downtown area of the town that seemed to really cash in on what the town is famous for. The street lights have eyes like "greys" and there's a few "Alien Research Centers" along with one "Alien Resistance HQ".  We went into what appeared to be the largest and most legit research center, the one that had the crash museum.  The museum was small but very cool, the lay out showed the timeline of events concerning the Rosewell crash and information and pictures from other sightings and incidents.  I personally wouldn't not consider Rosewell to be even possibly the greatest moment since the genesis of mankind... controlling fire, the first tool, creating mathematics... those would be good canidates for grest moments.  As it is Rosewell was just a crash with a few dead bodies, not exactly a meeting of the minds.  Besides, if man has met alien it has probably happened a few times to a few different civilizations over the course of man's time on earth.  Anyway, it was all fun and lunch was good, I had a corned beef sandwich while John had his Rosewell thing.  
<p>
The drive from Rosewell to Albuquerque was on a really pleasant two lane highway that wound through the hills and passed through a few small towns.  We passed near the White Sands Missle Test Range and Smokey the Bear's forest.  I was disappointed that we didn't see any UFO's or anything.  Maybe next time.

Lebanon, Missouri to Amarillo Texas
</b>
<br>
</font>

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#E4C9C9;">
<b><i>John</i></b>
<br>
Well, today we finally got out of Missouri. The car was fixed and ready to go shortly after noon ( oddly enough, one of the machenics at the Good Year, named James, used to live in Tulare County, CA, where I'm currently living -- he noticed our California plate. ) 
<p>
The previous evening I went on an excellent walk through Lebanon, and I made sure to snap more pictures of these beautiful streets, and various points around the city. As we left Missouri and made our way into Oklahoma, we stopped by...The Largest McDonald's In The World. No kidding. I vaguely recalled seeing it on the second trip ( the building crosses the freeway in a big arch ), but this time we actually stopped and ate there. Inside was various gifts to buy, and old McDonald's memoirabilia.
<p>
Then we stopped in Oklahoma City, at some mall, where, sure enough, we saw The Hitcher II readily available...and then continued onward into a stunning sunset.
<p>
Due to our "pit-stop" in Lebanon, the scheduled route was messed up, so we could only make it as far as Amarillo, Texas. As the night approached, we saw dark clouds off to the north, and lightning constantly pulsed red inside of them. I had never seen lightning strike so constant and so fast, and the color was odd -- definetly not the sort of storm we get in California.
<p>
Finally, we found our Motel 6 ( Texas sure has a lot of steakhouses... ), and made a note to drop by a local Hastings media store the next day. Tata...
<br><br>

<br>
The new radiator is working well and the trip to Amarillo Texas was uneventful.  On the last trip to Indianapolis back in '02 I remember telling John that I recalled seeing a huge McDonald's that straddled the freeway on one of the cross country trips I took with my mom when I was a kid.  I thought it was in Missouri (because of the arch) but was surprised to find it in Oklahoma.  My memory was still fuzzy this time around and I again thought it was in Missouri (because of the arch), I suppose it's true location would have stuck in my head a bit better had we stopped at it last time.  This time we actually did stop there to take pictures and eat.  I normally steer clear of McDonald's but I figured I could brave getting a Big Mac just so I can say I've eaten at the largest McDonald's in the world.  
<p>
I wasn't too surprised to see the Hitcher II at the mall after buying it the day before.  I believe we destroyed the spirit of the Hitcher (or at least weakened his power) when we found and purchased the DVD so it stands to reason that his ability to thwart our attempts at buying it would diminish, even if we're only looking to see if stores have it at this point.
<p>
The big cross in Missouri (there's a picture of it on the website here) has a twin in Texas.  Ironically John recalled seeing a huge cross in Missouri while I recalled seeing it in Texas, as it turns out we were both right.  I didn't get a chance to take a picture of the Texas cross, it was night time and it came up pretty fast.
<p>
G'night

<br>
Woke up early to get the car problem situated.  I just threw on some clothes and walked over to the garage next door to see how soon they could start work on the car.  They were all booked up when I initially check, but as it turns out someone canceled their appointment later in the morning and they would be able to diagnose and possibly fix the problem that day.  I went back to the motel and slept for the rest of the morning hoping to get rid of the cold I'm suffering from.
<p>
I awoke and got cleaned up right before check out time and I thought maybe the motel owner would give us a break and let us keep our stuff in the room while we waited to see if perhaps the car could be repaired today but he wasn't going for it.  I guess with the throngs of people flocking to Lebanon he just couldn't afford to let the room be occupied after 11am without making us pay (that's sarcasm btw).  I opted to check out and put all our stuff back in the car while John and I walked up the main boulevard to check out the shopping center and Wal-Mart to kill time, I was fairly confident that we could get another room if need be.
<p>
First thing we did was hit the local pawn shop, they had lots of movies and old video games along with the ususal assortment of pawn shop items, appliances, jewlery, etc..  I performed the obligatory search for the Hitcher 2 in the DVD section while John looked at CDs.  John had theorized the night before that perhaps we could find the Hitcher 2 in this town since it was an unexpected stop and the hitcher wouldn't know to stop here and remove copies of the movie off the store shelves.  As it turns out he was right.  With little fan fair and absolutely no climax I spotted the Hitcher 2 among the DVDs on the shelf.
<p>
We had lunch at Captain D's Seafood Restaurant.  I haven't eaten at one since I spent the summer in Kentucky with my great-grandparents over a decade ago.  It was as good as fast seafood can be, I had the Fish and Fries while John had the Shrimp basket... very exciting.  Afterward we went across the street to Wal-Mart and killed as much time as humanly possible there.  John bought some batteries while I stocked up on Darth Mix M&M's, I hope they keep the dark chocolate covered peanut M&M's after the Star Wars promotion is over, they're damn good.
<p>
The car will be fixed tomorrow, they had to order some parts.  We're here for another night.  The a-hole motel owner basically said "I told you so" and of course when he asked and I confirmed that it was being fixed next door he said I should have said something last night since <i>he</i> knows a better garage... he knew my car was busted when I checked in last night, at any rate I don't think I'd be trusting that bozo and his friend's garage anyway.  Prick.
<p>
The Hitcher 2 was no Hitcher 1 but it was a decent sequel I suppose.  I felt that they could have done a better job with the characters and the Hitcher as a person (or entity as John and myself describe him) but it was fairly enjoyable to watch with a few funny references to the first one.  However I didn't like the ending and it's lack of resolution.  It's not the kind of ending that leaves questions, it's the kind that just doesn't offer any logical closure... oh well.  I'd give it a C+ or a B- when comapred to it's predecessor. 
<p>
More pictures are up

<br>
Today was uneventful. Turns out the car can't be fixed until the local Good Year gets a part for Jay's radiator, so the ETA for our leaving is tomorrow morning/afternoon, which thereby requires us to spend a full day in this pit stop.
<p>
However, this didn't turn out too bad after all...after perusing a local authentic Missouran pawn shop...we found...The Hitcher II on DVD for only $ 6.
<p>
Now, what makes this tale all the more eerie is the fact that last night, I said to Jay : "You know, the hitcher didn't expect us to break down and stay in Lebanon, which means we'll be finding the DVD here..." And what happens today? We find it. That's a massive case of synchronicity, if not my subconcious mind conjuring it, or vice versa.
<p>
We also ate at a Captain D's, which is a mid-west/east coast seafood chain, and wasted some time at Wal-Mart. I got bored after I finished my Star Wars novel I was reading, so I went on a walk. I looked at a local map and found what looked like some nearby residential streets, so off I went...it was beautiful, and showed me a whole new side of Missouri. Sometimes, that's all it takes, is walking down a regular old street to get a flavor of someplace. The houses were large and kinda Victorian, the yards very big ( something not seen in California! ), and lots of green fields. The sunset I saw through huge rainclouds was awe-inspiring.
<p>
Well, we finished the evening with a Hardee's dinner, and watched The Hitcher II, which, despite Jay's vehement criticisms, isn't that bad of a sequel. Thoroughly enjoyable, if a little disappointing. Until tomorrow, my friends...

Indianapolis, Indiana to Lebanon, Missouri

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#A4BFEC;">
<b><i>Jason</i></b>
<br>
Today started out well, we left Indianapolis around noon after driving by the convention center one more time and stopping at the Krogers near our old CII Motel 6 to get some drinks.  We made good time through Indiana and Illinois stopping at a rest stop once and at a gas station.  It started raining the instant we entered Missouri and didn't stop until we did.  
<p>
As it turns out the radiator <i>was</i> leaking though it gave no signs of trouble after the two days in Indianapolis.  I suppose I should have had it checked out before we left but... oh well.  It had to happen at some point, we had no problems with the car on the last two trips and third time's the charm.  Now I'm left to wonder what caused the damage... was it the off road scenic route or was it something more sinister?
<p>
I was looking at the map trying to figure out if I wanted to push on all the way to Tulsa tonight when I noticed the check engine light turn on and the temperature gauge climb into the red.  I immediately pulled over to the side of the road and turned off the engine.  I checked under the hood and sure enough there was signs of coolant sprayed about the engine compartment.  I called AAA and after some confusion with my old membership number they dispatched a tow truck to pick us up.  As luck would have it we had just passed through Lebanon and were still on the outskirts of town when we stopped, so it wasn't too far of a tow back into town to the Garage and Motel.
<p>
I have a sore throat, which sucks of course but I'm just glad I wasn't sick during the Celebration.  The ear/sinus problem I was having on the way to Indianapolis went away before our arrival and I guess I stayed healthy just long enough for the convention.  I'm sure I caught the cold from one of the thirty thousand Celebration Attendees.
<p>
Maybe I can catch up on our pictures tomorrow...

Well, we left later than I expected today, going around Indianapolis ( which was now warm and sunny now that the Celebration was over! ) to various stores. Finally, after visiting a local Kroger, among other things, we were on our way...
<p>
Indiana and Illinois was pretty boring on the way back, but this time we stuck to the I-70. We passed by the arch in St. Louis, and then started our way across Missouri on the I-44, heading south-west just as rains started. After many boring hours, the car started to overheat...
<p>
Lovely. So, Jay called AAA, which he thankfully renewed his membership for just before we left on this trip, and then sent out a towtruck to come get us. Luckily we got a cool driver named Dennis, and he got us exactly what we needed ( albeit a few miles back... ) -- a repair garage which was near a motel/hotel.
<p>
To make a long story short, we're now stuck in Lebanon, Missouri until who knows when...See you soon!

Indianapolis, Indiana - Celebration Day IV - Final Day
</b>
<br>
</font>

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#E4C9C9;">
<b><i>John</i></b>
<br>
Well, we took our time getting to the Celebration today, sleeping in because there wasn't too many important presentations on the last day. We basically milled around the various halls, taking advantage of various photo opportunities with costumed fans as they became available. 
<p>
At one point, I tried to get a picture of myself with a Clonetrooper, continuing the Celebration "tradition" of getting photographed looking like I'm an Imperial prisoner. The first time was one trooper, the second one was Jay and I both captured and beaten by a squad, and this time it was to be the clone...Unfortunately, as he was a volunteer set to watch the doors and who had passes and whatnot, he couldn't do any specific poses. Not only that, but he sounded really pissed off, so I was trying not to laugh in the picture, and as it was taken and I took my camera back, I tried to say "Thanks", but some guy was already talking to him : "Chris..." "What?!" At that point I burst out laughing. Situations like that almost make the pictures better than I had originally wanted, because I know the story behind it.
<p>
When I split off by myself, I was able to finally find the TheForce.Net table in the Fan Fair hall ( how could I have missed it the last few days...? ), and got an autographed picture from Leanna Walsman, who plays Zam Wesell in Attack of the Clones. I had the idea of saying, "Could you sign it with some sort of proof that Zam 'likes' me?" So Leanna came up with her own thing and wrote, "To John, such a gorgeous fan", adding a heart. Am I in love...?
<p>
Later on I ( unfortunately ) had to miss the One-Man Star Wars Trilogy show ( very funny from the sample he gave at the Opening Ceremonies on Thursday... ) in order to have Timothy Zahn sign my all-time favorite Star Wars novel, Heir to the Empire. It was a book that greatly enhanced my fandom back at the age of 14, and I simply had to have his autograph. I also asked him a bit more about his rumored Luke and Mara novel, and he said that he is indeed signed to write it -- it's supposed to take place shortly after A New Hope and cover parallel events in both of their lives, before they had met and fallen in love. Later on, I saw Josh and Billy again, and we said our final "in-person" goodbyes.
<p>
We were going to try and hook up with Molly and Sara -- dressed up as Jaina Solo and Tenel Ka yesterday, but we couldn't get a hold of them on their cell phone. Ironically, though, we came across them just before we left today; this time they were dressed as Jaina as a pilot, and a Hapan Queen. We got a picture of them with us, and by themselves. We promised to keep in touch online. As we left the Celebration, and everything wound down, we got a bit wistful. We got a few pictures of the outside of the center and parking lot, and set off ( of course, also seeing Molly and Sara drive off...almost a sort of "exclamation point" for our leaving ), finally finishing the day early. 
<p>
We spent the evening scouring some stores, getting a pizza ( "What deals do you have?" "Uhhh, did you listen to the recorded menu?" "No." ), and watching Spaceballs. Tomorrow we leave Indy, headed for the long trek to California...
<br><br>

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#A4BFEC;">
<b><i>Jason</i></b>
<br>
John and I seperated for most of the day and the first thing I did was go upstairs for the interview with Nick Gillard, stunt and fight cooridnator for the prequels.  It was a lot more interesting than I thought it would be.  He talked about developing the Jedi's fighting style and his hope that he can one day create an instructional video or book to teach the new fighting technique.  Also he should be directing a movie with Sam Jackon and Hayden soon and is hoping that he'll get to work on the forth coming Star Wars television shows, if possible.  
<p>
I met up with John again for Timothy Zahn's discussion about his new book, Outbound Flight Project that will be coming out soon.  I'm always interested in stuff about the books, hence going to this and the Continuity Panel and such.  The audience had some good questions concerning his attitude toward other people using his characters, character origins and some stories he might do and ones he would have been interested in doing.
<p>
Once again we split up so he could do his own thing while I went to the Costume Cabaret.  I'm glad I didn't miss it, everyone gave great performances, singing, dancing, funny skits.  Leia singing the Life Day song from the Holiday Special was one of my favorites, along with the Jedi doing a beer polka.  
<p>
And that was pretty much it for the day.  We hung out as long as we could, getting pictures and such, we got another picture of a Stormtrooper capturing us, I tried to get a picture of Elvis Trooper capturing me (the angle didn't work out quite right) and I got a picture next to Darth Vader though he didn't seem to understand my request to have him give me rabbit ears in the picture.  I've had terrible luck communicating to the Sith Lords after last celebration's encounter with Young Palpatine when I told him he had a great costume.  I ran into him again the other day and once again tried to say something to him, I think I asked him if he was a big Palpatine fan... all I got was silence.  Speaking of which that's what John got when he tried calling Molly on the cell, heh.  But we did run into them again and got a picture, which was cool, though I was still a bit embarassed I suppose, we're not stalkers I swear!
<p>
As a side note, we found the Hitcher 2 DVD today... but it was only a rental at Blockbuster, it would seem that the Hitcher continues to taunt us by putting it so close to within our grasp.

Indianapolis, Indiana - Celebration Day III
</b>
<br>
</font>

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#E4C9C9;">
<b><i>John</i></b>
<br>
Well, today we slept in, not even *trying* to see George Lucas at Celebration III, knowing it would be impossible to do so. So, when we got inside, we tried to line up to see Billy Dee Williams. Thing is, Billy Dee was set to be interviewed in the same hall as Lucas...Suddenly, someone says, "You wanna see Lucas? Right this way..." "What about wristbands?" "No wristband needed..." Needless to say, we jammed in. The interview was nothing like I expected; the fans kept the ass-kissing to a minimum, all questions ( even from kids! ) were good, and everything was very concise. 
<p>
Then I met up with my friend from the Jedi Council boards, Josh, who was rooming the previous night with Billy ( The 2ndQuest ). We met up just seconds before Billy Dee came onstage during his thing, and afterwards we spent time talking. He respected our avoidance of Episode III spoilers, but he certainly hinted at things and somehow whetted our appetites even more for this movie. May 19th can't come sooner...
<p>
Then we all headed over to a "Continuity" panel discussion with various Star Wars authors and editors, and we met two girls in line -- Molly and Sara. We spent a lot of time laughing and talking, and we got along really well. Later on I exchanged numbers with Molly, so we could meet up tomorrow. I honestly had a crush on both of these girls, and seeing as how everything was dead with Heather ( see below )...why not?
<p>
Once in the panel area ( which involved Josh and I sneaking in with only one pass -- he couldn't get his; his was bought under his wife's name -- and avoiding "Imperial entanglements..." ), I asked a question about Star Tours ( the Disneyland Star Wars ride ), and how it might be "sledgehammered" into the timeline. In a nutshell, it had been attempted, but it's only "on the shelf" now. Josh asked a question right behind me,and then we left.
<p>
Next up was a Jake Lloyd interview, and it was weird seeing him now at 16 years of age; he was 8 when they filmed him as young Anakin in The Phantom Menace. But Jake is still as sharp as ever -- and he was really cool and forthcoming in all of his responses. After various other shenanigans ( which I'm sure Jay will mention...Oh, one of which was me talking briefly with author Aaron Allston... ) we watched The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones in the movie hall. It honestly was a bit sad for me to watch certain scenes between Anakin and Padme in each movie...Anakin's "Are you an angel?" bit in TPM, and Anakin and Padme rolling in the grass in AotC, what with April 23rd being Heather and I's anniversary. Last night Heather had e-mailed me, saying not to contact her. I'm honestly so tired of it; as far as I'm concerned, we're over. I tried. I really did. But I can't lie to myself forever.
<p>
The movies were great, and we and everyone else yelled out funny lines at key moments, making ot even better. We ended the night on a high note, despite my melancholy feelings.
<p>

"But you can't stop the change, anymore than you can stop the suns from setting..."<br>

<br>
After hearing that Lucas would be at CIII I never really thought that we'd get a chance to see him.  The demand to see him would far outweigh the amount of time he'd have available.  I also figured it would soak up a lot of the people and allow us good seats for the Billy Dee Williams interview scheduled shortly after the Lucas interviews.  As it turns out, the planets were in the correct alignment and our timing on sleeping-in and getting to the Celebration today worked out perfectly to allow us entry into presentation.  Like John said, we lined up for Billy Dee and ended up getting into the Lucas deal.  Not very fair considering people waited in line for hours in the early morning cold to get wrist bands to get in and we slept in and just sort of stumbled our way in... 
<p>
Billy Dee was great, as nice and humorous as ever.  He talked about his current acting projects, painting and a few Star Wars memories... those he can remember.  John and I like to make fun of the fact that he has trouble remembering certain things after he couldn't remember working on the then recent release of the Jedi Outcast video game.  We know it was just voice work and hard to remember working on something like that but we're such big Lando/Billy Dee fans, it's fun to poke fun.  He also talked briefly about the sexual innuendos in Return of the Jedi... the Sarlacc seemed to remind him of something...
<p>
Molly and Sara were both really cool, we all talked about books and our interests within the domain of Star Wars fandom.  I thought it would have been well enough to exchange Jedi Council Forum handles and give them John's number in case they want to meet up tomorrow at some point, but unecessary to get either of their numbers.  I feel that if they have the time and/or inclination they will contact us, it's better to let something like that be offered rather than requested, at least in this case. There's plenty of... shall we say, geeky fan boys running around at CIII.  Now that's not to say that I'm not a geeky fan boy, but I certainly don't want to come off as, well, desperate for a phone number I suppose.  Anyway, I guess I'm a bit embarassed at the brash request.
<p>
I stayed for the whole Jake Lloyd interview with Warwick Davis, John left to head over to the new book series discussion.  The interview was great, Jake talked about what he remembered of working on The Phantom Menace and toward the end of the interview Warwick Davis had Jake Pod Race a audience member on the Playstation 2 version of Pod Racer.  Jake won of course but the kid still got a Wicket the Ewok cookie jar signed by Warwick.  
<p>
Afterwards Josh and I (he was still with me) headed over to where John was and from there parted ways with Josh and went and watched both The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.  There was plenty of heckling going on during the movies, especially between the Jar Jar haters and us Jar Jar lovers.  99% of the jokes people made were funny and luckily no one shouted out any spoilers about what was to come in Revenge of the Sith.
<p>
Now, it's time for sleep.

Indianapolis, Indiana - Celebration Day II
</b>
<br>

<br>
We managed to wake up fairly early today and get out the door by about 8AM.  Of course, this didn't help us get into the Celebration any quicker because of the long line again but we were much farther up in line today.  Unfortunately, regardless of place in line we still got soaked by the rain this morning.  It brought back memories of the mud and the rain in Denver '99 and all the "fun" we had in spite of the sour weather conditions.
<p>
First thing was first after getting in the door, we headed upstairs and straight for the Hayden Christensen interview.  The interview was held via satellite with Hayden since he was shooting a movie in Italy.  Unfortunately because of technical difficulties involving the satellite feed, the interview was delayed almost two hours and instead of a live video feed it became just a phone interview.  Still, it was worth the wait, he answered some great questions about his own fandom and was really patient in spite of all the trouble surrounding the interview.
<p>
After Hayden we wandered around a bit looking for theforce.net's booth but after failing to do so we headed back up stairs to wait in line for the Ray Park interview.  It was a real treat seeing Ray again up on stage.  He wasn't at the last Celebration and with all the hubbub about ROTS going on right now it was nice to see a major player from TPM interviewed.  He gave a couple of short martial arts demonstrations on stage for us with a broom handle and a couple of feather dusters, compliments of Jay Laga'aia.  He also brought a bunch of fans with lightsabers up on stage and gave them a brief lesson on dramatic technique on handling a lightsaber.
<p>
We had a brief lunch down in the Fan Club Lounge before heading over to the Matthew Wood Sound Design Presentation.  He answered a few great questions about the business of sound design and how to break into the industry before presenting a short scene from ROTS that he broke down into it's different sound elements, sound effects, music, and dialog.  Both John and I were able to shut our ears and look away from the screen to avoid spoilers of any kind.
<p>
Afterward, we headed up stairs to get in line for the Fan Film Awards.  They weren't taping it to be shown on the Sci-Fi channel this time, so no chance of getting on TV again.  All the films this year were excellent and very funny.  Warwick Davis hosted the ceremony and showed a little film he had made.  It was called "Video... Something" neither John or myself can remember what it's called at the moment but it was funny.  Hopefully the title will come to us sometime soon.  As a surprise, he was presented a special award for pioneering fan films with his "Return of the Ewok", a funny little movie he made while working on Return of the Jedi.  Unfortunately it will never be released to the public because of licensing issues (not with Lucasfilm, other licenses) so the only way to see it is to attend a convention he's at.
<p>
We got back to the motel around 10:30pm and gtot to bed around 1:00am or so.
<br><br>
</font>

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#E4C9C9;">
<b><i>John</i></b>
<br>
Today was a miserable Celebration day. After only a few hours of sleep, we got to the convention center at a decent time, but the doors opened late, and the rain started. Of course, by the time we approached the entrance, the rain started pouring. It wasn't fun being cold inside the building thanks to my dampness, and my backpack got soaked ( ruining a few things ), and I had to carry around my soggy sweatshirt all day. 
<p>
Waiting in line for the "Hayden Chrsistensen Live From Italy" ( Hayden plays older Anakin in Episodes II and III ) presentation, we learned that it was only to be audioo and no video, as the sattelite equipment wasn't working, most likely due to weather. But, we got in with no problem, and the phone interview was great, despite a few hiccups when Hayden couldn't hear anything with the bad connection. I got in the line to ask him a question, but time ran out and I didn't get the chance. But, someone asked a cool question : What was his earliest Star Wars memory? Ironically, he said that when he was around 8 or 9, he used to pretend he was Darth Vader to scare his sister. Talk about foreshadowing.
<p>
The next thing we saw was Ray Park, who played Darth Maul in Episode I. He had a great presentation with some interview, video, and he showed off some of his martial arts. It was a real treat for me as a martial arts fan, and we did see Ray back at Celebration I -- not only his show then, but he showed up in downtown Denver at the Jar Jar Jam, which was a dance and concert featuring Ahmed Best ( Jar Jar in the SW prequels ), Rick McCallum, and Ray, who, on his walk up to the stage, I patted him on the back. I touched Darth Maul!
<p>
Next up was a small presentation with Matthew Wood, sound co-designer/editor for the SW prequels, and he showed off some new footage, showing the sound design layer by layer, all of which Jay and I had to avoid with our eyes and ears. Some ass next to me nudged me to look -- what a prick. Anyway, it was all good anyway, and Matthew Wood was a great guy.
<p>
We ended today with the SW FanFilm awards, hosted by Warwick Davis ( Wicket in Return of the Jedi, and the title character in Willow ), and saw tons of cool and funny films made by the fans themselves, on any budget, with a script that could go any direction; comedies, musicals, parodies. Lucas himself ( via a pre-taped interview ) picked a winner for the "George Lucas Select" award, and Warwick himself was presented with a sort of lifetime achievment award for his own small films he's directed, and his involvement with Lucasfilm over the years. It was a touching moment, as Jay and I are both big Warwick fans, and Howard Roffman, who presented him with the award, is a cool guy as well.
<p>
Of course, as the evening ended, and it was still raining, I got to put my wet sweatshirt back on for a good 15 minute walk back to the car. Welp, until tomorrow...

Indianapolis, Indiana - Celebration Day I
</b>
<br>
</font>

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#E4C9C9;">
<b><i>John</i></b>
<br>
Well, we woke up late today, but luckily we didn't need to be at the convention center until about noon, when the doors opened. Of course, at any Star Wars Celebration, nothing ever goes as planned when it comes to certain things, and the line outside lasted forever...roughly an hour and thirty minutes longer than it should have been.
<p>
So, once we got in, we waited in line for the Boba Fett Legacy presentation, which was interviews with Jeremy Bulloch ( Boba Fett in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi ) and Daniel Logan ( young Boba in Attack of the Clones. ) The presentation was MCed by Jay Laga'aia (sp?) who played Captain Typho in Episodes II and III. We got really close to the stage for this, so there'll be lots of good pictures to come.
<p>
Next up was an "interview" with Ian McDiarmid, who played Palpatine in all three of the new prequels, and Return of the Jedi. We expected a live appearance, but alas, it was a video interview. Nevertheless, it was extremely interesting, and Ian really delved into a myriad of details surrounding his work and the character(s) he portrays in the Star Wars saga. However, he didn't just spill beans with stuff that happens in Revenge of the Sith...but he threw the beans across the room. ( Me and Jay are avoiding all RotS spoilers and advertisements. ) So, in times like that, we put on our headphones and played music over whatever spoilerish images or conversation ensued.
<p>
After this, we had a short break and walked around the media and fan fair hall, and I got a few good deals...a Episode II Anakin figure, the Planet of the Hoojibs record/book, and an issue of Star Wars Galaxy Collector that I was missing. 
<p>
Then it was back to the line...for the Opening Ceremony, held late in the evening, rather than in the morning as at past Celebrations. During the wait, we met up with my Jedi Council board pal The2ndQuest, known on Earth as Billy. We had tons of good conversation as we waited, and we plan to meet up again in the days ahead. During the opening ceremony, with a Star Wars "walk of fame" with various cast and crew, past and present, walked the stage, Billy said one of the funniest things ever, as Ralph Brown ( Ric Olie ) walked onstage. Billy : "It's Ric Olie." I burst out laughing. Star Wars fans will get the joke...
<p>
I'm ommiting a lot of details of the day, but pictures can convey so much more, so more will be shown to my close friends and family in the days ahead, and I'll let the images do the speaking. So...we ended the night by watching some classic SW video in the Pop Culture room, and then left, the convention center nothing but a tomb until the next morning. Until then...sianara.
<br><br>
</font>

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#A4BFEC;">
<b><i>Jason</i></b>
<br>
I think the highlight of my day was the Ian McDiarmid interview, hearing him talk about Palpatine/Sidious, how he developed the character and what a unique opportunity it was to play the same character twice the way that he did.  Also he revealed that Sidious has a ton of dialogue and has some major lightsaber duels in the movie.  I didn't really consider that a spoiler per se but one thing I was spoiled on was the death of a certain character, who kills him and when he dies...  I knew the character was going to die but I didn't know any details, at least now I only know vague ones.  I took a chance on the spoilers in that presentation and I got burned.
<p>
So far the lines are long but worth it, we're off to a good start seeing everything we want to see, the major interviews and the opening ceremony and such.  Lots of great costumes as usual and plenty of Slave Leias this time... and others.
<p>
I think my radiator is leaking, I saw a bit of steam rising from under my hood tonight and though I originally thought it was just some built up moisture steaming off, when I checked under the hood it looked like there was some water collecting somewhere and a bit of bubbling going on.  With as little driving as needs to be done during the Celebration I don't think it will be an issue this weekend but I will have to get it checked out monday before we head out of town.  It appears we might be staying in Indy a little longer than anticipated.  I just hope it's nothing major...  "Hear me baby, hold together"

Indianapolis, Indiana - Off Day
</b>
<br>
</font>

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#E4C9C9;">
<b><i>John</i></b>
<br>
Today was pretty boring...we just moped around Indy and went to some stores. What made it worse is Indianapolis' convoluted highway system ( what with it being the "crossroads of America" and all ), and the fact that we couldn't even find the stores we went to last time we were here. However, I did find two Episode II Adventures kid's/game books for only 98 cents each.
<p>
We had Steak 'N' Shake for lunch, which is a infamous Indy resturant chain. I thought it was great until I realized my coke was made into a cherry coke by adding syrup, and I was charged extra for it. I hate to do it, but things like that make me boycott places just out of spite.
<p>
We did go by the Convention Center where CIII is being held...got our will-call passes and goody bags, scoped out the site. It's basically the same as 2002, which is very nice. We did meet a fellow Star Wars fan in front of the Hyatt ( or the Marriot...forget which ) who was very interesting and funny, if a bit overly jaded about the whole upcoming CIII event. We parted ways, perhaps seeing him again over the next few days.
<p>
We went to a couple malls, one of which smelled really bad throughout, although inside at a Suncoast, we came soooo close to finding The Hitcher II. The guy checked the computer, and then walked over to look in the racks...tension built up...and then nothing. Sort of like today, which was my birthday. It ended with me still not meeting Jess or Heather, and then a rainstorm hit us at the end of the night. It was a bit melancholy, but I had some respite in finally finding Asia's latest album, Silent Nation, at Sam Goody in a downtown mall. So that is lfted off my shoulders.
<p>
Anyway, tomorrow is the first day of Celebration III, and there should be a fat update sometime late in the evening, about all of the events we see and the people we meet. Still no word from Heather ( although I did leave a message for her to contact me through her mom ), and no word from Jess. Am I surprised? Hmm. Is C-3PO gay?

So... apparently Indiana doesn't observe daylight savings.  <i>Just</i> like last <b>time</b> we've been working on the wrong <b>time</b> since getting into Indianapolis, one hour ahead of the real <b>time</b>.  Luckily, this <b>time</b> we figured out the correct <b>time</b> before the Celebration started and discovered WHY we were on the wrong <b>time</b> this <b>time</b> and last <b>time</b>.  <b>Time</b> fucks me everything <b>time</b>... I hate daylight savings
<p>
I don't know how I'm going to contain myself this weekend and avoid spoilers.  John is taking it a bit to the extreme and trying to avoid looking at banners and signs at the convention that could possibly contain spoilers but I figure if its out in the open it can't be that big of a spoiler, especially this close to the movie.  I'll stay away from video and such but I'm not going to sheild my eyes from anything going on the next few days.
<p>
I can't wait to mingle with other Star Wars fans, maybe there will be some other Californians wandering around the halls.  It'll also be sweet to watch the old movies with other fans again.
<p>
Sleep now... we'll see how much we can update during the Celebration...  No <b>time</b> for pictures tonight

Kansas City, Missouri to Indianapolis, Indiana
</b>
<br>
</font>

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#E4C9C9;">
<b><i>John</i></b>
<br>
Today we left Kansas City, headed towards Indianapolis, crossing Missouri and Illinois in just a couple of hours each. Hmm...after living in California for so long, the size of other states feels so small, for good reason.
<p>
For sure, the greatest sighting of the day was a hawk flying over the highway, carrying a snake in its talons. Amazing, and we got a perfect, close view. It must've picked him up recently. Suddenly I'm hungry...
<p>
The rest of the day was relatively boring. We had a Hardee's lunch ( still weird to us Californians who are used to it being Carls Jr. ) Instead of taking the I-70 all the way into Indy, we took the parallel Highway 40 into the city, which passes through dozens of small towns with about sixteen variations on ____ Creek and ____ Ville in their names. The towns had a southern, earthy charm to them, though, and were really something special.
<p>
As we got into Indianapolis, we scouted for where the Celebration would be in one-and-a-half days, getting lost as per our usual habit. We did find it though, and the whole city is as familiar as ever, steaming manholes and all. ( Something I always thought was just in the movies...blame my locational knowledge yet again. )
<p>
We ended the night with an Arby's dinner, and I did some reading of my Star Wars novel as Jay watched Fast Times At Ridgement High. Still no responses from the dozens of times I called Heather. I'm starting to lose hope now; not just on her, but Jess meeting up with us too. We've heard nothing. Well, we'll see what happens tomorrow, as we explore Indianapolis further...
<br><br>
</font>

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#A4BFEC;">
<b><i>Jason</i></b>
<br>
We are now convinced that there is indeed a hitcher terrorizing us, always one step ahead, removing copies of The Hitcher 2 from store shelves.  The Hitcher has to be one of three people, Jess, Heather or Prophane (only one person reading this will know that name).  We dare not even think about the possiblity of all three of them being in league, planning our eventual demise.
<p>
What if our lives depended on finding this one movie?  We'd be dead...
<p>
We finally put the Celebration or Bust sign on the car today, I kept forgetting to buy tape each time we stopped.  Better late that never I guess.  The drive from KC to Indianapolis was shorter than I remember it even with our little detour.  Driving along that small highway reminded me a bit of Kentucky where my great grandparents used to live.  Pently of old houses and gravel roads, small towns and farm land...  I think it was the smells that really brought the memories back for me though.  
<p>
The interesting thing about Hardies is, there's no variety on the menu.  Almost everything on the menu is some sort of hamburger, there was only one chicken sandwhich and that's how far the variety goes in that place.  The biggers are pretty big too, John's simple hamburger might as well have been a Six Dollar burger from Carl's... I opted for two White Castle sized burgers, called "Slammers" and a small drink, I might live a bit longer for that I reckon.
<p>
That's it for tonight, I need sleep.  More pictures up per usual.  Probably a lot more tomorrow to pick up some slack.  G'night.

Denver, Colorado to Kansas City, Missouri
</b>
<br>
</font>

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#E4C9C9;">
<b><i>John</i></b>
<br>
Today was excellent, despite the long trek across all of Kansas, and more than a third of Denver. 
<p>
We did a few things in Denver before we started off, buying my Padme figure at Toys'R'Us ( alas, no Star Wars posters here... ), and getting some more pictures around town. Then we started off for the journey across the great plains...
<p>
In 2002, Kansas was a bit of a bummer, what with the speeding ticket we got, and the overcast, humid weather. The weather this time was warm and sunny with puffy clouds, and as the evening approached, the air was filled with storm clouds and strong winds.  
<p>
I tried calling Heather again today, but just got an answering machine each time I called. As it is, my cell phone was roaming most of the time, or didn't even have a signal, so I didn't do much calling until we approached civilization, from Topeka onward. 
<p>
We almost got screwed with one thing. Jay forgot to stop for gas as we left Denver. I remembered, but I had assumed he was planning to stop out of town, on the way. So when the car started shuddering about two hours east, he knew what was up. We ran on fumes, just barely making it to a gas station in Limon, CO. While gassing up, I was briefly bit by some weird bug, thinking a bee had stung me. Luckily it was nothing. Then, some guy was a beard and funny hat came up to Jay and I, asking for some money. Jay gave him a few dollars, but I had nothing to spare, really. However, he did point out that with my hair and beard, I looked like George Michael. Funny, as I thought he looked like Aquinas from Genghis Khan II for Sega Genesis.
<p>
As we headed east, we stopped briefly for a snack lunch ( I'm sure Jay will mention it, but all of those rest stops in Kansas look the same! ), and we got a great picture of us standing near a billboard for Big Wong's cafe. I had wanted a picture of that ever since the last trip, and finally my mission in life was fulfilled.
<p>
Later on, we stopped at a charming little gas station, and I got some good pictures of some ducks at a nearby pond. One walked away and went to go hang out with about ten cats that a lady in the back was feeding. They probably wondered why I was taking pictures of them.
<p>
Finally, after about nine hours of driving, we arrived in Kansas City -- on the Missouri side. And here we are, actually getting in at a decent time and getting a nice fattening meal at Wendy's. Until tomorrow, adieu.
<br><br>
</font>

<font style="font-family:Tahoma;font-size:75%;color:#A4BFEC;">
<b><i>Jason</i></b>
<br>
Indeed we did <i>almost</i> run out of gas.  I had planned to stop somewhere right outside of Denver to gas up and instead I kept pushing the envelope farther and farther until the car started choking and I had to slow down to conserve fuel.  If anyone has seen "The Dealership" episode of Seinfeld it was much like the Kramer thread of that story with him taking a test drive with a salesmen in an Audi and seeing how far they can go before they run out of gas.  Anyway, with a bit of luck we managed to pull into the gas station without incident.  I ended up going about 430 miles on that tank of gas, just about the best mileage I've ever gotten out of my car, 27mpg.  I gave the weirdo with the hat a few dollars because of the incredible luck I had just had.
<p>
Plenty of State Troopers on the road today but no tickets!  I drove conservatively to avoid getting pulled over but I think the radar detector only went off one or two times the whole day.  In any case, instead of Kansas costing me $115 like last time they only dinged me $2 for the turnpike.  Speaking of which, if not for the absolute need for seeing again and capturing a picture of the Big Wong's sign we would have taken the northern route through Nebraska to get to Indiana.  One sign had the power to dictate our route.
<p>
Eh, I'm tired of writing, time to edit pictures.

Bah, no rain or snow today.  The Weather Channel's forecast called for rain across most of Colorado yet there was hardly a hint of showers for most of the drive.  Snow would have been nice, it snowed in the Rockies during our first trip.  But I guess we'll just have to settle for clear skies on our trek through the Centennial State.
<p>
Shortly after stopping for a few snacks at a gas station called Gay Johnson's we found the infamous scenic route.  We were determined not to miss it this time around after letting it pass us by on the last trip.  We were always under the impression that we had taken a wrong turn when we first took the byway... as it turns out, we hadn't.  The unpaved road is actually part of the route (about 1/3).  Considering how uneven and hairy the road gets they really should put some sort of warning at the entrance to it.  Of course, both time we failed to stop and look at the big map at the beginning of the byway so it's probably our own fault. Even though the unpaved part is apparently part of the normal route it was still as creepy as we remembered it, maybe more so with us playing the Unsolved Mysteries theme on that leg of the journey.
<p>
We got into Denver and checked into our Motel 6 around 4pm.  As I was checking in, the woman at the front desk mentioned that I was in the computer as a past guest.  I was surprised to learn that they keep records on that sort of thing including what rooms people had.  I requested one of our previous rooms and we got #115, our room on the last trip.  Nice that it's on the first floor but we would have liked to have stayed on the second floor in our old home away from home back in '99, oh well.
<p>
After getting situated at the Motel we went out to visit some of the sites and stores we visited on the original trip including Jar Jar Jam Church, Aurora Mall, the legendary Media Play and of course the site of the original Celebration - the Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum.  The mall and Media Play both had great deals on books I needed but neither had the Hitcher II... it would seem the conspiracy to keep us from seeing this cinematic gem persists.  The Jar Jar Jam church hasn't changed a bit, however the area around the museum has been built up with new condos being constructed right on top of the site where the tents from the first Celebration were put up.  That's progress I guess.
<p>
I'm tired... John needs a license... goodnight

Hello everybody! Today was another great day on the trip, despite *still* not finding The Hitcher II DVD. We left Grand Junction a little later than we should have, but we got some good pictures on our way out of the nearby jet statue, in addition to other things. Had breakfast at Gay Johnson's gas station/food mart ( Hehe. )
<p>
Now comes something interesting...the Colorado "Scenic Route". This was a small highway/road/gravel path that branches off from I-170, shoertly after Grand Junction, and is basically the 330, going off in a crescent, before hooking back up with the 70 again.  But...along the way is some treacherous dirt roads, unmarked locations, and several turns which don't appear on any nation-wide atlas map such as the ones we're using. We did take this byway on the original Celebration trip to Denver in 1999, but we missed it in 2002, as it's very hard to notice when it comes up suddenly. Despite the rough road and the extra time to get back to civilization, there's some beautiful scenery of trees, snowy fields and muddy creeks. Throughout most of this segment of the trip, Geoff Downes played on the car stereo, his classical and ambient playing very much setting the mood.
<p>
After our two rest stops somewhere in the Rockies ( complete with a ritualistic sacrifice of Jay's original piece of broken sunglasses -- see his CII trip text, and a shard from a 
Britney Spears CD-R that wouldn't work for us at the beginning of the trip ), we passed through the snowy forests and made our way into Denver.  
<p>
We crammed a lot into today, and all in all, was as satisfying as I expected it to be. We got our same Motel 6 that we always did, hit up some bookstores, music stores, and even found a mall that we visited back in 1999. On that trip, I had bought Heather an astrology book at a Walden's Books in the mall. On *this* trip Jay and I partook in a Star Wars book deal in which for every two paperbacks you buy, one is free. Seeing as how I needed a lot of the Clone Wars books to read before I see Revenge of the Sith ( opening at a theater near you, May 19th ) I went ahead and had him put them on my trip "tab" of which I owe him later, when I'm actually employed again. ( Sigh. )
<p>
Also, we hit one of our favorite stores in Denver -- MediaPlay. This is where we got our first glimpse of non-toy Phantom Menace merchandise, and the store still impressed in certain ways ( Jay got some bargain SW hardbacks ), but I couldn't find Asia's Silent Nation album, nor anything else of bargain/value to me. Ah well. Next time.
<p>
Next up, we visited the Wings Over The Rockies Air & Space Musueum, which held the Celebration I convention in 1999. As the last time we visited here ( in 2002 ) the area was built up with nearby tract homes, but now there was even more buildings and admin stuff, right where tents and stages held Star Wars actors and crewman six years earlier. We got some excellent photos here . . .
<p>
 . . . And I decided to go ahead and call Heather...to see if she wanted to meet me in Indianapolis a few days from now. I was nervous as I made the call, but it wasn't as bad as when the day slowly creeped forward, previously, when I thought about it. In the end, I couldn't get a hold of her, but her mom said she was now living with  her sister, nearby in her same old hometown of Greenback, TN. I left a message for her there, and I guess I'll attempt another call tomorrow. Thankfully, I do feel a lot more hopeful about the situation between us, and I know that whatever happens, things will work. Listening to my new Asia compilation and hearing "Heat of the Moment" during a stunning orange sunset really steeled my resolve for the future.
<p>
We ended the evening by getting some pictures of where the Jar Jar Jam was held in '99, at some old converted church sorta building, and we called Jess, hoping she could still meet up with us in Indianapolis for the Celebration. Jay and I have known Jess for eight years, as we all met on AOL back in the day and became friends. If we can finally meet here in Indy, "the circle will be complete." Nothing concrete in her plans yet, but we'll know more by the time we're at or just after Kansas City. 
<p>
After a Boston Market dinner back at the motel, a perrenial walk I take in the neighborhood by the Motel 6, and some relaxing watching the Phantom Menace DVD extras and some music videos, we signed off for the night. Until tomorrow . . .

Today I was awoken by the sound of John taking a shower.  I was surprised the Anakin Alarm didn't wake me up but I suppose I was so tired from yesterday's drive and going to bed so late even the infamous Anakin Skywalker couldn't rouse me from my slumber.  After dragging myself out of bed and showering, we rushed down to Shoney's Restaurant to take advantage of the complimentary breakfast coupons they gave us when we checked in.  I was expecting a simple spread of fruit, coffee and maybe some toast, instead we were pleasantly surprised by scrambled eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, bacon and toast.  Not bad for a free breakfast I reckon.
<p>
After breakfast we gathered up our things, packed up the car and snapped and few pictures around town, including the mysterious motel school we saw on the previous trip in 2002.  I managed to get a panoramic shot of the building from across the street and although we thought about going in and asking about the school and the details surrounding it's creating and choice of buildings, we decided instead to hit the road.
<p>
We headed out of St. George at about 12:30pm and were greeted by a largely empty highway.  I would have thought the highways would be busy on a Saturday but I guess everyone has better things to do in exciting Utah.  The landscape and scenery was as beautiful as we remember with it's snowy mountains, red hills and interesting rock formations.  We made sure to stop at the same scenic stop we visited the last two trips and spent a half hour eating lunch, taking pictures and relaxing.  The rest of the drive was great.  Plenty of great tunes, hardly any cars on the road and no headaches (thankfully).  We did see one hitch hiker but we didn't pick him up... and for good reason.
<p>
We pulled into the Motel 6 at 6:30pm and almost immediately headed over to the local mall to continue our search for the elusive Hitcher II on DVD.  We watched the first Hitcher here in Grand Junction on our previous trip.  We bought The Hitcher on DVD before leaving orange County and although we weren't able to find the sequel before we left we figured we'd be able to find it <i>somewhere</i> on the road... we were wrong.  We still haven't found the movie after exhausting all of Grand Junction's movie retailer options but we still have hope that the conspiracy to keep us from watching the Hitcher II has not reached as far as Media Play in Denver...
<p>
Anyway, that's it.  I'm sure John will fill in any holes with his entry.  Now it's time to enjoy watching The Hitcher and see Rutger Hauer terrorize C. Thomas Howell and Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Good night.
<p>
P.S. Some pics are up... a lot more will go up when we get more time.

Well, today was much more low-key than yesterday, thankfully. We had a free complimentary breakfast, courtesy of the Ramada, at nearby Shoney's Resturant, and after getting a few pictures of St. George and the surrounding area ( as well as getting my prerequiset candy at the Rite-Aid ), we set off. 
<p>
The scenery was again beautiful on this second day, with lots of snowy caps and light forest throughout south Utah, and the west on the I-70 was rife with dusty desert hills and clear blue skies. we listened to some great music for the road, including Asia, Sting and Johnny Cash. Once we got to our regular rest stop, we took some excellent pictures of the surrounding canyons. 
<p>
Finally, we arrived in Grand Junction. We tried ( in vain ) to find The Hitcher II DVD, to go along with the original The Hitcher, which we're watching tonight, in "celebration" of seeing the movie for the first time on the second trip out here, in 2002. Anyway, we had no luck at Borders, Super Wal-Mart, Target, various malls and shopping centers. Places we scoured, calls were made, but the Hitcher II is not within our grasp. Yet. Thankfully (well, aside from paying full price ), I did break down and buy my 2-CD Asia collection, as well as a Star Wars Premiere magazine at the Barnes & Noble here in GJ. After some relaxing with the movie and eating a satisfying Burger King meal, it's time to retire for the day.
<p>
Tomorrow should be interesting, as we head to our favorite old haunts in Denver ( where the first Star Wars Celebration was held in 1999 ), we pass through the Rockies, which should be nice and snowy what with the chilly high-elevation weather in the area, and...I'll be attempting to call Heather, to see if she wants to meet in Indianapolis in a few days. May the Force be with me...

<br>
What a day! If today was a harbinger of what's to come on the rest of this trip, then I don't know what to expect!
<p>
Where do I start? Well, the day began with a lawnmower outside the window, followed by annoying old Anakin and Artoo in the Naboo starfighter ( Jay's loud alarm clock that we've taken on these Celebration trips. ) I got ready pretty fast, and I had packed the previous night, thankfully. Jay had a few things to do still, so I busied myself with finishing a Star Wars novel that I didn't want to have to bring. I finished it by the time we had to leave. Of course, leaving presented problems...had to run back up for more items, and then even after we drove off, Jay went back for his sunglasses. 
<p>
Once we were on our way, Jay had a mishap in his driving, which ended up with us rear-ending some guy in an Intrepid. Had to hit the breaks quite hard, but the cars did smack. Thankfully no damage was done ( aside from some minor dings to Jay's license plate ), and the other guy was extremely cool, and we were back on the road after less than a minute. Now that was luck.
<p>
Then we made a few stops...Borders and Fry's, in which we tried to find The Hitcher II DVD, and an Asia 2-CD set for myself, both of which seem to not be in any store in California, or if they are, are overpriced. After eating some Weinerschnitzel we were our way onto the 15 out of San Bernadino...And then...
<p>
...We hit the worst traffic I've ever seen in my entire life. Turns out it was a nearby brush fire which required us to pass through the area about 2-3 hours behind schedule. Ironically, this made us as late as when we last made the roadtrip.
<p>
The desert was beautiful once we actually made it to the Mojave, and we passed through Las Vegas at sunset. Finally we came upon St. George, Utah...site of Motel 6 ( used on the first trip ), and TravelLodge ( second trip. ) Apparently St. George, pit stop of America, was quite popular tonight, as both places were full, and everything else in town was, too. One dingy place, run by some Indian guy, asked $99 for a double. After we hesitated after hearing the price, he chimed in with, "You might as well take it, lucky you get any room tonight." What's funny is that I actually considered the price until he made that dumb comment, and looking at the shape of the place ( with it's 1984, 1986 and 1987...hmm, recent..."recommendation" plaques, one of which was crooked on the wall ), we scratched gravel. 
<p>
We considered travelling to nearby Hurricane, or Leeds, for a room, but we finally gave the Ramada a shot, which we expected would be pricey. I went in not expecting anything. The girl at the counter looked at me forlornly, with a "Sorry". I started off -- when suddenly she realized there *was* a double available -- it had just become available minutes before, and it was $ 89. Without consulting Jay, who waited in the car for yet another disappoinment, I accepted. We got a ( relative ) bargain, and it's the poshed motel *I* ever stayed in, I think. So we got our keys, went off for some Taco Bell ( the annual dinner stop here ), avoided St. George's bad drivers, and got back and relaxed, watching my DVD of Go. Despite how easy it is to get lost in here, this is nice. Oh, and to top off the night, the fire alarm rang twice for some reason. From lawnmowers to fire alarms...Sigh.

The original plan was to write our entries independantly but we'll see how that goes.  I imagine that sometimes we will and other times we'll just add to the other's entry, depending on how we're feeling.  Anyway, I guess he covered the day's events pretty well, however...  The morning started off as I expected, we woke up at about 9am and although we "planned" on leaving at 10am it was more like noon by the time we left the house.  I still needed to pick up a tripod and cooler from Aaron, mail a couple of packages (long overdue) and renew my AAA membership.  With all that and more left to do, somehow I knew we wouldn't be leaving any earlier than 11am.  
<p>
I expected the traffic and though I wouldn't say it was the worst <i>I've</i> seen, it was pretty rotten.  It's to be expected though, heading eastbound on a Friday afternoon.  Speaking of traffic, I did indeed give a guy in a grey Intrepid a love tap with my license plate.  I forgot that with all the added weight in my car its stopping distance changed a bit.  The added weight is thanks in large part to John's purple laundry basket full of books.  That's right folks, it's back and badder than ever, ready for another trip across the country.  I managed to bring just four books and fit those in my main pack.  But hey, I don't have to lug the basket around so more power to him.
<p>
I had a splitting headache and was fairly nauseated by the time we rolled into St. George so I was in no mood for all the "No Vacancy" signs up at all the motels around town.  Luckily we did try the Ramada and here we are...  It's a bit on the pricey side and it's a smoking room but it's better than nothing and the girl working the front desk was cute...  After some food and rest my headache is gone and I'm ready for bed.
<p>
Before I go to bed though, it's weird being on this road again after three years.  The last trip seemed to herald major changes in my life and though I don't expect this one is heralding anything other than a good time, I am thoughtful about everything that has happened in the past three years....
<p>
More tomorrow, including pictures.

Well, we're setting off in less than 12 hours for what could be the greatest of the three Star Wars Celebration trips. We have better cameras, equipment, music, planning, and time is on our side with many things. As for myself, this is either the beginning of what could be the greatest days of my life, or some of the darkest, depending on what happens between Heather and I, and the choices made. Time will tell...
<br><br>
All I can really say is that I plan to have fun regardless, and I'm looking forward to nostalgic Star Wars memories of the past, and the future of my favorite space series.

Hello to all my peeps.  As I suspected we would be, we're up late the night before we leave... it seems there's never enough time to get everything in order.  Like John I'm excited about the trip.  I'm really looking forward to getting out on the open road and away for a while.  More later...

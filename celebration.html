					The Man, The Myth, The Legend, Anthony Daniels (aka C-3PO).  Here he's getting
					some well deserved lovin' from two fine ladies (You'll see more of them later
					on), well deserved because that was taken in line for the main hall under a
					tent in the rain.  He had come out to say hello to some of the people waiting
					in line during one of his very short breaks inbetween MCing the presentation
					tent.  I couldn't believe how nice he was to do that.  A really excellent guy!

					Here's Mr. Daniels MCing at the presentation tent, letting someone near us ask
					a question.  While he was hostnig he wore a gold jacket, it was very cool. 
					Looking back on this picture I feel bad about taking it, at that point a lot of
					people were taking pictures of him and all the flashes, including mine, must
					have been annoying.

				<blockquote>
					This picture was taken at the Jar Jar Jam.  After the second day of the
					Celebration, on Saturday night, there was a small concert at a local church
					(used to be a church anyway).  Ahmed Best's aka Jar Jar Brinks (shut up I like
					Jar Jar) band performed, it wasn't quite hiphop and it wasn't quite rock n'
					roll, it was sort of inbetween.  I'm sure there's a name for it but I haven't a
					clue what to call it.  At any rate it was pretty good and it got most everyone
					in the place dancing and having a good time.  This picture shows Darth Vader
					and one of his goons crashing the party.

					Now this is a great picture.  Not only does it have Anthony Daniels in it but

					I was so proud of myself in this picture.  In the main hall they had several

					I had to include this one.  This one was taken at the Jar Jar Jam.  I'm not
					sure why we wanted stupid pictures taken of us under one of the banners there
					but what's even more ridiculous is the fact that John screwed up the picture. 
					Actually I think it makes the picture better, at least it's not just a stupid
					picture of me under that banner.

				<blockquote>
					Looking at this I'm surprised we didn't die of heart attacks shortly after the
					Celebration.  That's a lot of junk food and that's pretty much all we ate
					besides fast food.  Lets see, from top to bottom it looks like we had some
					cookies, cheese crackers, a small bag of chips, Fritos, Easy Cheese, white
					powdered dognuts and some Keebler Cookies.  You can also see there, right next
					to the Fritos on the left, "Slave Ship" from The Bounty Hunter Wars trilogy, by
					far the worst trilogy of books ever written for Star Wars.

					Another picture of our room, and another mess.  A lot of junk including my

					This picture was taken by John at the Jar Jar Jam.  The girl is wearing what I

					John doing the same routine.  His turned out great though, I love the fear on

					Last but not least we have one of the big Star Wars soda can ballons falling

					snuck into so many of them . . . honest :-)
